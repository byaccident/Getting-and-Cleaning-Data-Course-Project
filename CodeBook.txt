and contains measurements pertaining to six activities (walking, walking_upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, laying) while subjects wore a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II). Measurements were taken with an accelerometer and a gyroscope in XYZ directions(tBodyACC XYZ, tGravityAcc-XYZ) . This data was used to derive Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ), magnitude (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). Additionally a Fast Fourier Transform was applied to some of the signals denoted by the f in place of the t (e.g fBodyAcc-XYZ). From this data the experimenters estimated various measurements. Included in this dataset are the means and standard deviations of all measurements for each subject during each activity.

See below for a concise list of the variables in the dataset:

measure: the mean or std statistic of a particular axis derived from observations using an taken by an accelerometer or a gyroscope

activty: one of six activities (walking, walking_upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, laying) the subject was performing during the observation

subject: subject number

mean: the average of the listed measure for the given activity for the given subject
